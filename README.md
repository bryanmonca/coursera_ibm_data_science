# Coursera_ibm_data_science
I am currently working on the Coursera - [IBM's Data Science Certification](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). I have read good comments about it, so I decided to give it a try.
The course I am working on right now is Python for Data Science, AI & Development. It is the 4th course in a series of 10.
